                <div class="description">
                <p>Kol Isha* is a collective on a quest to unveil the relationship between power and voice as they relate to gender and sex. We gather in community to sing traditional Jewish songs, niggunim (wordless melodies), zemirot (Shabbat songs), and our own written tunes. Our purpose is to awaken the vibrancy of personal and collective voice. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Come join our first retreat March 9-11th in the Bay Area, CA</p>

<p>Kol Isha = the voice of a woman*</p>

<p>The Talmud Berakhot 24 says: </p>
<img src="img/talmud.png" class="talmud" style="width: auto;max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
<p>Shmuel says: A woman’s voice is nakedness, as it is stated “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring” (Song of Songs 2:14).</p>
                <br>

<p>This passage has been used to silence the voices across history. Various reasons have been given to justify this, such as the erotic power of woman’s voice might overcome a man in prayer, it is required for a woman to be modest and contain herself because of her spiritual powers, the voices of women are too distracting, etc. We recognize the beauty of our tradition and understand that silencing is never justified. This project is designed to remove the blockages created through silencing and unleash the majestic power trapped in hidden locations in our bodies. </p>
                <br>

<p>*Who is a woman? We are interpreting this to mean one who has been disempowered. We are calling forward the voices of marginalized identities to sing, scream, cry their voices into the space together. This includes self-identified women, gender queer and trans folks, and all those who have suffered from historical oppression.</p>
